# YOLOv3-ROS
The purpose of this repo is to provide an easy-to-use, customizable and scalable object-detection library for ROS.
It uses YOLOv3's deep neural network along with the darknet architecture to predicts objects in an image frame. 
This solution was built for a Turtlebot3 Waffle Pi, but can easily be adapted for any ROS environment, as discussed later on.
It is important to note that you will need to provide your own weights for the model, as YOLOv3 weights are often too large 
to store on GitHub. You can find more info [here](https://google.com), and this will be touched on later in setup. <br><br>
